    <h2>What is shortcut.cool?</h2>
    <p>Shortcut.cool is a simple demo that let's you create your own personalised shortcut icons and install them to your homescreen.</p>
    <p>Chrome on Android has the ability to create homescreen icons that have context allowing you quick access to parts
      of the app. For example, Twitter has "new Tweet" and "new Direct Message". This tool allows you to create an icon
      that has your own links.</p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>I love .new domains, and some of the things that you can do with them (i.e, <a href="https://docs.new">docs.new/</a>).</p>
    <p>I wanted the ability for people to be able to create a list of their own actions.</p>
    <p>I merged the two ideas together.</p>
    <h2>What browsers and OS's does this work on?</h2>
    <p>Right now it's only tested on Chrome on Android.</p>
